mousebender
###########
A package for installing fully-specified Python packages.

Package contents
================

- ``mousebender.simple`` -- Parsers for the `simple repository API`_

Goals for this project
======================

The goal is to provide a package which could install all dependencies as frozen by a tool like `pip-tools`_ via an API (or put another way, what is required to install ``pip`` w/o using pip itself?). This avoids relying on pip's CLI to do installations but instead provide a programmatic API. It also helps discover any holes in specifications and/or packages for providing full support for Python package installation based on standards.

The steps to installing a package
---------------------------------

`PyPA specifications`_

#. Figure out what packages are necessary

    #. For an app, read lock file (?)
    #. For a package:

        #. Read list of dependencies (?)
        #. *Solve dependency constraints* (ResolveLib_)

#. Get the wheel to install

    #. Check if package is already installed (`spec <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/recording-installed-packages/>`__ / `importlib-metadata`_)
    #. Check local wheel cache (?; `how pip does it <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#caching>`__)
    #. Choose appropriate file from PyPI/index

        #. Process the list of files (`simple repository API`_ / `mousebender.simple`)
        #. Calculate best-fitting wheel (`spec <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/>`__ / `packaging.tags`_)
        #. If no wheel found ...

            #. Select and download the sdist (?)
            #. Build the wheel (`PEP 517`_, `PEP 518`_ / pep517_)

    #. *Download the wheel*
    #. Cache the wheel locally (?)

#. Install the wheel

   #. Install the files (`spec <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/distribution-formats/>`__ / `distlib.wheel`_)
   #. Record the installation (`spec <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/recording-installed-packages/>`__ / ?)


Where does the name come from?
==============================
The customer from `Monty Python's cheese shop sketch`_ is named "Mr. Mousebender". And in case you don't know, the original name of PyPI_ was the Cheeseshop after the Monty Python sketch.
